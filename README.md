Any value can be used on any ability, but eachvalue can only be used once.

###### Backstory
Please consider your backstory for your character, which will be explored through the campaign as you roleplay. It is not necessary for you to explain this to other players, if you would prefer this to be revealed as the campaign progresses.
You will be required to have known each other for a short time before the campaign starts, so please include room within your backstory for the following questions to be answered:
- Why are you in Jigow?
- How did you get there (if not native)?
- How did you meet the party? (Please figure this one out as a group)

The [Inverted Heroic Chronicle](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR2djBuKmG3rx1PzGn6md34LXQhuqDfUOUoUHWxG64ZFK8s1SPE-DR0qzVjoFqGXXlg3bK5x8B9xkdX/pub) can be used to find out where a particular race may have grown up, which can assist you in developing your backstory.

Please use the [Heroic Chronicle](https://5e.tools/book.html#egw,5,heroic%20chronicle) featured in The Explorer's Guide to Wildmount to assist you in coming up with ideas for your backstory (you do not need to roll for the tables, select your preference). It gives a good step by step on how to create a character that feels beleivable for the setting. Choose a fateful moment that you feel will benefit your backstory if you choose, or create your own similar in nature to the ones featured.
